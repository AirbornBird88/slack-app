# slack-app
Slack integration with a third party service

Specifically, it is about integrating **Slack** with the **Zoho Projects** application.
We want to summarize work time of employees (from a specific company) in the last month.
Or in other words how many hours each employee worked in the last month.
Then we will send this information to a Slack channel.
So we will work with *Slack API* and *ZOHO API* (REST API and webhooks), 
in addition also with *Slack commands* and authorization processes.
